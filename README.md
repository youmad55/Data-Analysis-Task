# Data-Analysis-Task
Data Analysis Final Project
Project Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of the Data Analysis Final Assignment.
All required tasks defined in the assignment have been fully completed, except for the Bonus section.

The project focuses on time-series analysis, statistical methods, data visualization, and predictive modeling using a real-world electricity consumption dataset.

Dataset

Dataset Name: Zurich Electricity Consumption Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Download Link:

The dataset was selected because it is suitable for:

Time-series analysis

Seasonal and periodic pattern detection

Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing

Regression and predictive modeling
